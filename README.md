# go variable

There are two rules for variables

var and const declaring

frist one var

Use the var keyword, followed by variable name and type:

### Syntax
```go
var variablename type = value
```

### Syntax
```go
var name string = "hyeon"
var age int = 27
var cash float32 = 4.99
var true_and_false bool = true
```

With the := sign

### Syntax
```go
name := "hyeon"
age := 27
var cash := 4.99
var true_and_false := true
```

## const variable

When we program there are variables that should not be changed In that case, we use const

### Syntax
```go
const age int = 27
```
